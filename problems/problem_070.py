# Required state:
#    * author name, a string
#    * title, a string
#
# Behavior:
#    * get_author: should return "Author: «author name»"
#    * get_title:  should return "Title: «title»"
#
# Example:
#    book = Book("Natalie Zina Walschots", "Hench")

# at the last one you just wrote unless you really must.
